# Statistical Arbitrage: Statistical Arbitrage is a quant trading strategy that looks for pairs of stocks that have a high correlation and then trades them based on the deviation of their
# spread from the historical mean. The following code shows an example of implementing a statistical arbitrage strategy using Python and the Pandas library:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the historical data for two stocks into a Pandas DataFrame
df1 = pd.read_csv('stock1_data.csv')
df2 = pd.read_csv('stock2_data.csv')

# Calculate the spread between the two stocks
df1['spread'] = df1['close'] - df2['close']

# Calculate the rolling mean and standard deviation of the spread
mean = df1['spread'].rolling(window=30).mean()
std = df1['spread'].rolling(window=30).std()

# Create a signal column that indicates when to buy (1) or sell (-1)
df1['signal'] = np.where(df1['spread'] > mean + 2*std, 1, -1)

# Calculate the daily returns using the signal
df1['returns'] = df1['spread'] * df1['signal'].shift(1)

# Calculate the cumulative returns over time
df1['cumulative_returns'] = (1 + df1['
