# Risk Management: Risk management is a crucial aspect of quant trading, and there are many different techniques that can be used to manage risk. The following code shows an example of calculating Value at Risk (VaR) using Python and the NumPy library:

import numpy as np

# Calculate the daily returns of a stock
returns = np.random.normal(0, 0.02, 1000)

# Calculate the 99% VaR
var = np.percentile(returns, 1)

# Print the result
print("Value at Risk:", round(var, 4))
